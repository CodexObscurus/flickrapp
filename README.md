flickrapp:

This is a streaming interface for a Flickr JSON feed. It streams the public Flickr timeline, adding newly-uploaded images to the display every 3 seconds. It can be stopped and the images opened with colorbox, or information read by hovering over the relevant link, then resumed by clicking start.
